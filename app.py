        Demand forecasting can be useful for many important sectors like health, finance, food, and many more. It is important for the
        industries to predict the correct demand of supplies, which will enable them to produce the right amount of supplies in time
        of need. This helps to avoid wastage, and at the same time meet the requirements of the consumer.

        To perform Demand forecasting, open source data from a particular store was used.
